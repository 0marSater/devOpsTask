# DevOps Assignment

This project is a part of a DevOps assignment that aims to assess your knowledge in various DevOps topics and tools. The assignment is divided into three parts, as outlined below:

## Part 1: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster
- ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- ALB (Application Load balancer controller) 

## Part 2: Building a Simple Web Application and Setting up CI/CD Pipeline

Here, you will develop a simple web application and establish a CI/CD pipeline for it. The web application will have the following APIs:

- ***http//hostname/client-ip*** - Accepts client requests and saves the public IP in the RDS database.
- ***http//hostname/client-ip/list*** - Displays the list of IPs saved in the RDS database.
- Build a Docker image for the web application.
- Automate the Docker image build and push process to the private ECR using scripts (in my case i did with two external groovy scripts) 
		-> "__build.groovy__" and "__push.groovy__".
  
## Part 3: Deployment with Helm Chart on __AWS EKS__
   - Create a Helm chart that includes all the necessary k8s resources to deploy the web application on AWS EKS.
   - The Helm chart can be found in the ***taskchart*** folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For first part This repository contains the necessary resources for provisioning the infrastructure using Terraform. 

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the ***terraform*** folder.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize all modules and providers.
3. Use `terraform apply --auto-approve` to create the entire infrastructure.
4. Once the infrastructure is created, two outputs will be displayed on your screen: ***db_instance_address*** and ***repository_url***.
 Copy these values and paste them in the appropriate locations in the build.groovy and push.groovy files.
 and in ***main.py*** file you will paste ***db_instance_address*** to enable your app to connect to the database.

For more information about the resources used, please refer to the README file inside the ***terraform*** folder.



# Web App Development with Flask and Docker

- I have developed a simple web app with two APIs ***(client-ip, client-ip)*** using __FLASK__.

The CI/CD pipeline for this project is implemented using Jenkins. It consists of three stages:

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the project repository into the Jenkins pipeline workspace.
2. **Build Image:** Build the Docker image using the ***build.groovy*** script.
3. **Push to ECR:** Push the Docker image to a private ECR repository using the ***push.groovy*** script.

Refer to the ***Jenkinsfile*** for more details about the CI/CD pipeline stages.



## Deploy web app on EKS using Helm chart 
- After filling both groovy files with ( ***db_instance_address*** and ***repository_url*** ) values.
- Run `helm install myapp` ***./taskchart`*** and that will deploy the app and its related resource on ***EKS***.


#To access the web app: 
------------------------
1. Run `kubectl get ingress`.
2. Locate the IP address in the output and navigate to that IP in your web browser.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#Cleaning up all works
---------------------
1. `helm uninstall myapp` 
2. Navigate to the ***terraform*** folder.
3. Run `terraform destroy --auto-approve` to destroy and clean up all resource.

#Helpful commands you will use 
-------------------------------
- `aws congiure`: remotly connect to ur aws account with AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID, and region.
- `aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <REGION> --name <EKS_NAME>`: to update .kubeconfig in ur host with the created one on eks.
- `kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>`: to point and use the created eks cluster.
