## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

![Project strcuture](../Images/projectStructure.png)


The `modules` directory contains subfolders for each module. Each module has its `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `output.tf` files, which define the module's configuration, input variables, and output values, respectively.

The root directory contains the following files:

- `main.tf`: The main configuration file that declares all the modules used in the project.
- `variables.tf`: The file where you can define and customize variables used across the project.
- `output.tf`: The file specifying the outputs to be displayed after provisioning the infrastructure.
- `terraform.tfvars`: The file where you can set the values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`.
